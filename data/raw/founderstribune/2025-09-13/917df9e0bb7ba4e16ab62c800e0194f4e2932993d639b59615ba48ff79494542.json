This essay is an abridged excerpt of a blog post Marc published in 2007.\n\nCompanies that are winning —even really big, old ones— never have a retention problem . Everyone wants to stay, and when someone does leave, it’s really easy to get someone great to take her place.\n\nCompanies that have a retention problem usually have a winning problem . Or rather, a “not winning” problem . […]\n\nThe only way a company in that situation can retain great people is to start winning again.\n\nGreat people want to work at a winner.\n\nAll the raises, perks, and HR-sponsored “company values” drafting sessions in the world won’t help you retain great people if you’re not winning—not even the $6,000 heated Japanese toilets in all the restrooms, the $30,000 Olympic lap pool out back, and the free $4 bottles of organic orange juice in all the snack rooms.\n\nThis seems deeply unfair when you’re going through it, because when you’re not winning, that’s exactly when you need all those great people the most!\n\nOh well. That’s the price we pay for living in a society where jobs aren’t for life anymore.\n\nSo the right question is, how can we start winning again? […]\n\nIn general, the intangibles that keep great people are: the quality of the people they’re working with, the interestingness level of their projects, and whether they are learning and growing.\n\nThe tangibles are: winning, and a high stock price.\n\nAs the leader, you have to really believe that you can get your company back to winning and therefore back to a high stock price.\n\nIf not, you should sell the company.\n\nIf you’d like an essay like this sent directly to your inbox every Sunday, subscribe to the free newsletter.\n\nIf you’re a founder and would like to contribute an Op-Ed to this publication, please email [email protected] .\n\nThe Founders' Tribune\n\nA new Op-Ed platform for founders.
